# COVIDAPP
The objective of this project is to provide an app or a website to help patients, nurses and doctors to have  access faster to the medical system. In this system, patients are able to register and perform a self- assessment test in order to get help from a doctor or a nurse. After registering and performing the self- assessment test, these data will be communicated to a nurse for consultation. A nurse will determine to  consult more with the patient by giving him/her appointment, or assign the patient to a doctor, or not accepting the patient because the symptoms are not serious. After assigning a patient to a doctor, doctor can go over the patientâ€™s information including the self-assessment test and provide an appointment to the patient. If there is no need to see the patient, the doctor can reject the patient. In either cases, the patient will be notified. All the data will be stored in a database in order to provide different type of reports for the management.
